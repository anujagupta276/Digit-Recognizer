# Digit-Recognizer
A Machine Learing project

This is a Machine learning Project , which recognize hand written digits using SVM (Support vector machine). For training and testing data set , I have used Sci-Kit learn's  "digits" dataset for classification.
Here is a python script for the same.

# Features
Each digit image is 8x8 pixel. In the data set, each sample is represented by a normalized 8x8=64 dimensional vector. I directly use this vector as the feature vector of each sample.
